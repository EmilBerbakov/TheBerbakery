<!--TODO:
Card that takes in an image, name, and maybe description from the recipe service.
On the bottom third, there will be a gradiant background on top of the image, and the name of the recipe and the description will be there.
There will be an on-hover expansion of the card, perhaps even expanding in such a way that the full description is readible
